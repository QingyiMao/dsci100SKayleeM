    "## Forecasting Server Demand: Identifying Peak Hours of Minecraft Gameplay Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background: \n",
    "In large-scale online gaming environments, managing server resources efficiently is crucial to ensuring a smooth user experience. If too many players attempt to connect simultaneously and there are not enough software licenses or server capacity to support them, gameplay can be disrupted or denied. To support a research study on video game behavior, the Department of Computer Science at UBC operates a Minecraft server where player activity is recorded. Understanding when server usage is at its highest is critical for planning infrastructure needs such as licensing and hardware allocation. Demand forecasting in this context helps administrators anticipate periods of high activity and proactively allocate sufficient resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question: \n",
    "Question 3: At what times of day and on which days of the week is the Minecraft server most likely to experience a high number of simultaneous players?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Description: \n",
    "This project uses the dataset provided by the UBC Minecraft research server team. The data consist of two CSV files: players.csv and sessions.csv. For this analysis, only the sessions.csv file is used, as it contains detailed information about when each player was active on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Name         | Type     | Description                                                                 |\n",
    "|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `hashedEmail`         | string   | An anonymized identifier for each player|\n",
    "| `start_time`          | string   | Timestamp of when the session started|\n",
    "| `end_time`            | string   | Timestamp of when the session ended|\n",
    "| `original_start_time` | numeric  | UNIX timestamp (milliseconds) of session start — not used in this project  |\n",
    "| `original_end_time`   | numeric  | UNIX timestamp (milliseconds) of session end — not used in this project    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of observations (rows): ~1000 (exact count depends on filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of variables used: 3 (start_time, end_time, hashedEmail)\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values: Some sessions may contain invalid or missing timestamps; these will be filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumed time zone: All timestamps are assumed to be in the same time zone for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity: Session-level — each row indicates a single player's activity duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential issues:\n",
    "The timestamps are in string format and need to be parsed to extract useful temporal features (e.g., hour of day, day of week).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods & Results:\n",
    "describe the methods you used to perform your analysis from beginning to end that narrates the analysis code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code:\n",
    "loads data \n",
    "wrangles and cleans the data to the format necessary for the planned analysis\n",
    "performs a summary of the data set that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned analysis \n",
    "creates a visualization of the dataset that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned analysis\n",
    "Use our visualization best practices to make high-quality plots (make sure to include labels, titles, units of measurement, etc)\n",
    "Explain any insights you gain from these plots that are relevant to address your question\n",
    "performs the data analysis. For your analysis, you should think about and provide a brief explanation of the following questions:\n",
    "Why is this method appropriate?\n",
    "Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?\n",
    "What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?\n",
    "How did you compare and select the model?\n",
    "Note: you should also think about the following:\n",
    "How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross validation?\n",
    "creates a visualization of the analysis \n",
    "note: all figures should have a figure number and a legend\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion:\n",
    "summarize what you found\n",
    "discuss whether this is what you expected to find?\n",
    "discuss what impact could such findings have?\n",
    "discuss what future questions could this lead to?\n",
    "\n",
    "## References:\n",
    "You may include references if necessary, as long as they all have a consistent citation style."
